# Polarization Simulation Project

Welcome! In this project, you’ll explore **light polarization** through code-based visualizations and data analysis. This guide will walk you through how to **fork**, **clone**, and **run** the project on your own system using **Visual Studio Code**.

---

#Getting Started

To begin working with this project, follow these steps to set up everything on your computer.



#Fork This Repository

First, you need your own copy of this project on GitHub:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page.
2. This creates a copy of the repository in **your own GitHub account**.



# Clone Your Repository Locally

Now that you have your own version, you’ll bring it to your computer:

1. Go to your **forked repository** on GitHub.
2. Click the green **Code** button and copy the HTTPS URL.
3. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
4. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
5. Type and select **“Git: Clone”**.
6. Paste the URL and select a local folder to save the project.

Alternatively, you can clone it from the terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Polarization.git
cd Polarization
```



# Install Required Libraries

Before running the code, make sure your Python environment has all the necessary packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt`, you might install these commonly used ones:

```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```


# Run the Polarization Tool

To visualize and analyze polarization patterns:

```sh
python combined.py
```

If your project contains multiple files or folders, check the script or instructions inside the `README` or relevant subfolder.

# Experiment Freely

You're encouraged to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of polarization!

- **Make changes only in your local or forked repository.**
- To save your progress:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Experimented with polarization angle"
git push origin main
```

# Troubleshooting

- **Matplotlib Warning?**
  If you see:  
  `UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout...`  
  It's safe to ignore, or consider using `constrained_layout=True` in your plot setup.

- **Missing Packages?**
  Install any missing packages individually:
  ```sh
  pip install package-name
  ```



#Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to share your work:

1. Push your final changes to your **forked repository**.
2. Share the **link to your fork** with your instructor or teammates.
